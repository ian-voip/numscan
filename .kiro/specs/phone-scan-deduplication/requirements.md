## Introduction

The phone number scanning system currently has a logic issue where multiple hangup events for the same phone number call result in duplicate processing and overwriting of scan results. This leads to inconsistent and confusing results where the final outcome may not reflect the actual call behavior. The system needs to be enhanced to properly handle multiple FreeSWITCH events for the same call and ensure that each phone number scan produces a single, accurate result.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the phone scanning system to handle multiple FreeSWITCH events for the same call correctly, so that each phone number produces only one accurate scan result.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a phone number receives multiple hangup events THEN the system SHALL process only the first meaningful hangup event and ignore subsequent ones
2. WHEN a call is answered and then hangs up THEN the system SHALL record the result as "answered" regardless of the hangup cause
3. WHEN multiple hangup events occur for the same call UUID THEN the system SHALL deduplicate the events and process only the most relevant one

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring the system, I want clear logging that shows when duplicate events are being ignored, so that I can verify the deduplication logic is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate hangup event is received THEN the system SHALL log that the event is being ignored with the reason
2. WHEN the first hangup event for a call is processed THEN the system SHALL log the processing with call details
3. WHEN call state tracking is updated THEN the system SHALL log the state change for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the scan results to accurately reflect the actual call outcome, so that I can trust the data for business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call is answered (CHANNEL_ANSWER event received) THEN the final result SHALL always be marked as "answered" regardless of subsequent hangup causes
2. WHEN a call is not answered but receives multiple hangup events THEN the system SHALL use the first hangup cause as the final result
3. WHEN a call times out without any meaningful response THEN the system SHALL mark it as "timeout" or "no answer" appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the call state management to be thread-safe and consistent, so that concurrent processing doesn't cause race conditions or data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple goroutines process events for the same call THEN the system SHALL use proper synchronization to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN call state is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic operations to maintain data consistency
3. WHEN checking if a call has already been processed THEN the system SHALL use thread-safe mechanisms to prevent duplicate processing
